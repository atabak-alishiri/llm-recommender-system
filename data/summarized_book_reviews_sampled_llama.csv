0375506276,The Fourth Hand,3.4782608695652173,"In one of his shortest novels to date, Irving weaves three interlocking stories and themes. A reporter for a tabloid-style news channel, Patrick Wallingford gains international notoriety when he loses his hand to a lion in a videocast that his employer shamelessly milks for ratings. Wallingford then falls in love with the Wisconsin-based widow of the donor whose hand is surgically attached as a replacement, but tension results between his comopolitan world \\""in which sexual anarchy ruled\\"" and her relatively chaste, laid-back Green Bay upbringing. And, finally, Irving uses the death of John F. Kennedy, Jr., and the crash of EgyptAir 990 as backdrops for a scathing and contemptuous denunciation of the crisis-driven television news industry.<br />There's also a pleasing and comical subplot about the hand surgeon and his strained relationships with his ex-wife (who loathes him), his son, and his maid. Irving devotes a whole chapter to introducing them, but all the characters involved are entirely forgotten in the last half of the book. They are probably meant to foreshadow Wallingford's own story, but the parallels seem lopsided.<br />Most of the characters display Irving's trademark eccentricities, but none of them fills the role spot on. Simultaneously amiable and thoughtless, Wallingford transforms himself from an empty-headed playboy to a paternal and solicitous gentleman caller, but the metamorphosis seems strained. The reader never quite understands what motivates Doris (often referred to as Mrs. Clausen), the somewhat unemotional and all-too-practical widow. Patrick's conniving, near-hysterical colleague, who wants to have his job and his baby, borders on all-too-familiar sexist stereotype. More than a few additional characters make repeated appearances in the early chapters, only to exit the stage inexplicably well before the final act.<br />In addition, a noticeable number of paragraphs follow a bizarre and cloying pattern: two or three sentences--sometimes non sequiturs--preceding a cute or explanatory parenthetical aside that serves only to describe something that, all too often, should have been mentioned elsewhere.<br />At times it feels that Irving wanted to write a type of fiction different from the farcically Dickensian, three-ring-circus novels to which his readers are accustomed. One can never fault a writer for wanting to branch out--but, in this case, different is not in which is."
0385503857,"Oryx and Crake: A Novel (Atwood, Margaret Eleanor)",4.15,"Fortunately, there are writers who are excellent time after time.  There are just a handful of them but Margaret Atwood is undoubtedly one of them.  Every time I read one of her books I go away impressed.  Oryx and Crake is no exception.<br /><br />This novel is another novel of a dystopian future along the lines of The Handmaid's Tale.  Here we have a narrator, Snowman, telling us of his friend, Crake, who destroys human life so his genetically altered humans (called Crakers) can have the earth as their own.  Oryx is a former sex slave who Crake has found to educate his Crakers but with whom Snowman falls madly in love, leading Crake to take vengeance.  Snowman is telling us all this in flashbacks as he tries to get by in a world where he is, as far as he knows, the only \\""normal\\"" human left.<br /><br />Of course, this is only a sketchy outline of what is, in fact, a novel with incredible depth.  Ms. Atwood's ability to draw for us a very possible future of high-tech \\""gated\\"" communities separated from the mass of common people, a world where everyone relies on the Internet, sex, drugs and genetic alteration to make there lives livable is amazing.  She is also gifted at creating memorable characters like Snowman and Oryx, in particular, and an entire world of altered beings like pigoons (genetically altered pigs), rakunks (a cross between a racoon and a skunk) and the Crakers.<br /><br />Thematically, the fact that this horrible world Atwood creates does not seem so far away is chilling.  It makes a reader really think about everything from the social effect of the Internet to the ethics of genetic manipulation.  What I was pleased to find most of all, however, is the note of optimism.  Yes, things are horrible but, even after the destruction, human beings (normal ones and genetically altered ones) survive somehow and struggle to begin again.<br /><br />There are so many ways human beings may bring about there own destruction but I believe strongly that, somehow, people will always find some way to survive and build again even if brought to the brink.  Ms. Atwood has given us a version of this and it is plausible and well-done, if disturbing.  I recommend it.how, people will always find some, i.evene."
0385502532,Drowning Ruth: A Novel (Oprah's Book Club),3.6842105263157894,"&quot;Drowning Ruth&quot; is a promising first novel, bound to do well with Oprah's coveted approval.  Written in the style of Daphne DuMaurier, with a few well-defined characters, and secrets hidden over long years, this book will keep your interest.  The climactic four or five pages at the end are satisfying, and all the plot ends are tied up.<br />For someone who grew up in the lake country, in the midwest as I did, the geographic setting is familiar, and Schwarz does a fine job of depicting Wisconsin land and lakescapes.  She also has a master touch in describing women's relationships-- sisters, mothers, daughters, friends.  (That is probably why Oprah latched onto the book.)  Her touch is less adept at fleshing out the male characters, but she gives it a good try.<br />This is a light, entertaining read although its plotlines are heavily Gothic.  You'll easily step into the world of Amanda, Ruth and Mattie, and the events of their circumscribed lives will easily engage you and stir your sympathies. As a mystery author with my debut novel in its initial release, I found Christina Schwarz's DROWNING RUTH fascinating.  It is a historical novel set in a time period we would all recognize as modern.  The story takes place early in the 20th Century.  It involves a young woman who struggles to deal with all of her society's restrictive expectations upon young women in that era as well as with her own personal desires for her life.  Amanda Starkey is a Lutheran girl who finds herself forbidden from marrying a Catholic boy in rural Wisconsin.  She becomes a nurse in Milwaukee, and she finds herself seduced by a man into what was then considered dishonor.  She returns to the family farm where a number of family members die--some from the influenza epidemic sweeping the world.  Caring for her drowned sister's child becomes primarily her responsibility, even after her brother-in-law returns from WWI.  As the story progresses, there are many questions that need to be answered and once the answers arrive, they are most enlightening.  DROWNING RUTH is a terrific first novel. I saw DROWNING RUTH in the book store and considered it but did not know anyone who had read it. I saw a woman in an airport and inquired whether or not she liked it but she had not started it. For some reason I was relunctant that it was it is in. It was not it in fact. in IT."
0385472951,The Partner,4.0,"I consider this to be Grisham's best book.  It has a snappy story line with a nicely complex plot, believable characters and a really good twisted ending (which I have to confess I had not anticipated).<br />This is one of those books which you pretty much end up reading at one sitting - you know the type, where you'll just read one more chapter before putting it down, and before you know it, you've finished.<br />A very enjoyable book, great for Mr Grisham's existing fans, and a good place to start for new ones. Well, as a fan of John Grisham, it is difficult for me to find the negatives in his work. However, in &quot;The Partner&quot;, I found myself floundering to continue reading. And I do believe Grisham is now groping to  keep up with the high demand for his books.<br />The plot seemed like a  &quot;plug &amp; play&quot; device. Lawyer, Patrick Lanigan steals millions  from his huge law firm. His troubles really begin when they find him in  Brazil, living a quiet life as Danilo Silva.<br />This is quasi so-so read,  but nothing compared to Grisham's first, &quot;A Time To  Kill&quot;.<br />Thanks--CDS 2000, LLC, I's Â  &nbsp;"
1576737330,The Prayer of Jabez:  Breaking Through to the Blessed Life,3.4375,"The customers who have reviewed this book negatively and said that it is about selfishness obviously have not read the book. Or they have not read it carefully. The prayer  in this small book  is simply about opening oneself to what GOD wants and intends for us. Period. The biblical passage on which the book is based simply points out that we humans (who have free will) have to ASK for God's blessings. The prayer is simply a variation of \\""Ask and ye shall receive\\"" or \\""God helps those that help themselves.\\"" I can't imagine what some of the fearful book reviewers find so scary or unorthodox in that. There's nothing new in the idea. It is supported by Scripture! This book is a lovely reminder that our Father waits to bestow blessings -- if we ASK. Bruce Wilkinson's &quot;The Prayer of Jabez&quot;, a popular bestseller that deals with the Jabez Prayer (from 1 Chronicles 4:10) which basically encourage Christians to pray for God's blessing. It is a simple prayer asked by a man named Jabez who prayed to God that He would bless him, expand his territory and that the Lord's hand would always be with Jabez and keep him from evil. God did grant Jabez for what he requested. Wilkinson showed how this simple prayer can be extremely powerful.<br />Wilkinson explains each of the verses (of the Jabez Prayer) and how we can apply it to our lives. I thought it was interesting how Wilkinson noted that Christians take for granted the word &quot;bless&quot; as it is so overly used. He pointed out that asking God to bless us is actually &quot;crying out for the wonderful, unlimited goodness that only God has the power to know abour or give to us.&quot; It is a short and easy to read book with a simple yet important message. This little book has now been out for a few years.  It's made it's millions of dollars and sold its millions of copies.  The sequels have also made their fortunes.  There are Prayer of Jabez calendars, journals, Bibles, inspirational guides, The Prayer of Jabez for Teens, and The Prayer of Jabez for Preschoolers.  I am surprized there are not Prayer of Jabez Pez despensers.  Personally I always wondered why preschoolers needed a Prayer of Jabez?  Couldn't they just ask their parents for permission to cross the street and thereby enlarge their territories?<br?&es, that? to The bests? the best of. Please? of prayer's of &ampers?

014023828X,The Tortilla Curtain (Penguin Books with Reading Guides),4.166666666666667,"The Tortilla Curtain is introduced by a quote from The Grapes of Wrath, an appropriate citation as T.C. Boyle's novel is in many ways a 1990s follow-up to Steinbeck's classic novel.  Even structurally, there are similarities between the two books as each alternates points of view in each chapter.  But even if this is a follow-up, it is not a rewrite, as this story covers new ground. <br /> <br />A bit of recent California history:  in 1994, the state passed Proposition 187, a law designed to deny public services (in particular health care and education) to illegal immigrants.  The proponents of this law stated it was a necessary step to keep state resources from getting overly depleted.  The opponents decried the law as racist and unconstitutional.  Just as there were two sides in the Prop 187 debate, there are two similar sides in The Tortilla Curtain, written shortly after this law was passed. <br /> <br />On one side are Delaney and Kyra Mossbacher, an upper-middle class couple living on the outskirts of the San Fernando Valley.  In general, they are politically liberal, but events transpire that make both of them turn to the right on the illegal immigration issue.  On the other side are Candido and America Rincon, two such immigrants who are struggling to exist, desperately trying to find work and not even eking out enough of an existence to have shelter or eat regularly.  The ways the lives of these four people intersect over the course of several months forms the basis of the novel. <br /> <br />If there is a central character, it is Delaney who we watch slowly changing from tolerance to indifference to hate for the many Mexicans, Salvadorans and other immigrants that seem to be everywhere in his life.  Where does Boyle himself seem to come down on this issue?  It's hard to say:  he obviously has sympathy for both sides, but also is willing to indict both sides.  This makes The Tortilla Curtain a book that will both irritate people at either extreme and pleasethose more towards the middle. <br /> <br />Personally, I enjoyed this book although it is admittedly not perfect.  In particular, the immigration issue so permeates this story that it is hard to believe the characters think of much else.  For the Rincons, barely surviving from day to day, this may be understandable, but for the Mossbachers and is to, and, which, is the most 2nd is that the least, then, or it, while in it and ial and then. The way to make it's, that is, not, all the one is still"
0743476239,Nervous: A Novel,4.8,"This book was hot to death!!! I loved this book, I loved the multiple personalities it portrayed. My favortie personality was Jude she didn't [givein to anybody] and did what she wanted. She was hella freaky, by all means. As I read this book she tripped me out. The things she said about the main character Jonquinette had me literally cracking up. (...) <br />The book didn't ave a lot of sexual content if that's what you are looking for, but the book was dayum sure good.<br />Later!!! Meet Jonquinette.  A studious hard working young woman who is out on her own and working the everyday nine-to-five and living the'same ole', same ole' structure that is her life.  Meet Jude, a vivacious woman of pure sexual energy who will take and make any man who will glance her way.  Jude's sexual appetite would make Rick James break into tears.  So, what's the big deal?  Try that they're seperate personalities living in one body.  Jon's handling the day-to-day responsibilities of life, while Jude takes over at night to get her nasty on with whatever guy is awake and in her line of fire.  Jon realizes what is happening and seeks a psychologist to help her get rid of Jude.  The bigger issue is that Jude is able to see what goes on while Jon is awake, and decided that she is going to have to destroy Jon's neat little world, piece by piece, until she becomes the dominate player and Jon reverts all control to her, once and for all.  This is such a twisted little game that it grabs you by the collar and doesn't let go until the final act, when the pieces of their lives become more fractured.  Off the chain, Zane! Jonquinette Pierce has never had a boyfriend, never made love, never even had strong friendships with other women, but her body has. The weekdays belong to Jonquinette--weekends and nights, to Jude. Jude emerged in second grade, when Jonquinette was being picked on by other girls. Jude wasn't afraid to break the rules, to use violence to protect her fellow self. And when Jonquinette's fears drive her from sex, Jude takes over that part of her existance as well. But now, Jonquinette is seeking psychiatric help--and Jude is threatened. Will she destroy their common body in her efforts to fight back, or will she, perhaps, that he's, we shall not, on, in."
0060929871,Brave New World,4.53125,"+++++<br /><br />This science fiction novel by author Aldous Huxley is considered by some to be \\""The greatest novel of the future ever written.\\""  Why?  Because as the late, great philosopher Bertrand Russell said, \\""It is all likely to come true.\\""<br /><br />Huxley through one of his characters early on makes this startling statement: \\""[T]he secret of happiness and virtue [is] liking what you've got to do.  [Techniques have to be developed so] people like [or love] their non-escapable social destiny [of servitude].\\""<br /><br />In this novel, this \\""love of servitude\\"" has been accomplished through suitable scientific techniques.  The result is an antiseptic new world where \\""[t]he world's [socially] stable...People are [artificially] happy;  they get what they want, and never want what they can't get.  They're well off; they're safe; they're never ill; they're not afraid of death; they're blissfully ignorant of passion and old age; they're plagued with no mothers or fathers; they've got no wives, or children, or lovers to feel strongly about; they're so conditioned that they...can't help behaving as they ought to behave.  And if anything goes wrong, there's the [universal, pleasurable drug] soma [as well as recreational sex].\\""<br /><br />Conditioning is the technique for establishing desirable behavior patterns.  \\""Soma\\"" in this novel is a powerful calming and hallucinogenic drug without any serious side effects.<br /><br />There's \\""no mothers and fathers\\"" because a foolproof system of eugenics (the movement for improving the human species through control of hereditary factors) has been mechanically designed to standardize humans in places called \\""hatcheries.\\""  This mechanical standardization of humans has been pushed to fantastic though, I feel not impossible, extremes.  The system of mechanical eugenics in this novel enables humans to be \\""processed\\"" into classes based on intelligence.<br /><br />This novel is filled with numerous interesting concepts and ideas.  For example, the time this novel takes place in is 632 \\""A.F.\\""  A.F. stands for After the Death of Ford.  This refers to Henry Ford (1863 to 1944."
0345392825,Reviving Ophelia: Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls (Ballantine Reader's Circle),4.375,"When I first read this book five years ago, my daughter was only eleven, on the brink of the age that author Pipher addresses here.  At the time, the book was recommended in a circle of mothers as a must-read.  Now I am revisiting it as the mother of a sixteen-year old daughter, and I find it just as relevant than I did on first reading.  Sure life has changed from its first publication a decade ago, but the stresses of growing up and dealing with the cattiness of adolescent girls is both timeless and universal.  Girls hurt - and hurt themselves - in different ways than boys.<br />Pipher does an excellent job demonstrating her points through case studies she has personally encountered during her career as a professional psychologist.  By seeing how Pipher helped these troubled girls overcome with their lack of self-esteem and coping mechanisms, parents are given the tools to help their own daughters, hopefully before the problems become too large to be dealt with at home.  The warning signs of depression, drug use, sexual activity, eating disorders, and more are outlined within the text, exposing the varied symptoms that take into account the individuality of each girl.  The biggest lesson parents should take away from this book is this: these disorders and behaviors can happen to any family, to any child, even the most seemingly obedient and happy.  Every girl, no matter how successful socially or academically, suffers during this transition period between childhood and womanhood.  The question is always this: How much?<br />I advise parents to read this book before your child enters adolescence so you will be better prepared for this turbulent time.  However, if you already have a troubled teen, it's not too late.  This book is not a substitute for much needed therapy for the most extreme cases, but it offers parents the comfort of knowing that both they and their daughter are not alone in their struggles. With the pressures to be like their pop idols, girls are more focused now on measuring up to external images, rather than going inside themselves, and honoring who they are meant to be.<br />Girls also struggle more now with opposing messages such as, &quot;Be beautiful,&quot; versus, &quot;Beauty is only skin-deep.&quot;<br />Other messages include, &quot;Be smart, but not so smart;&quot; and, &quot;Be honest, but don't hurt anyone's feelings.&quot;<br />And they are taught &quot;Not pleasing others, which,which&gt; to which is &lt; & &gt;. &nd;&l&c;hence, or&;which is&g,&gtl &l&lt;so;lt;&lt;/s&"
0316769487,The Catcher in the Rye,4.393939393939394,"Catcher in the Rye is a great book. Holden, even with all his negativity, is still one of the best characters in literary history. The best part of the book is that Salinger doesnt try and sugar coat stuff, being not afraid to have a few f-words in his book. A masterpiece of American literature. J. D. Salinger first published this novel amidst much controversy in 1951. Deemed as one of the first books written both for and about teenagers, which ultimately resulted in the \\""young adult\\"" genre, \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" was banned in most schools and still is in many cases. The protagonist is the sixteen-year-old Holden Caulfield, who narrates his own life experience of New York in the two days after he is expelled from his school. Filled with swearing, slang, teen angst and an awkward sexual encounter, the character of Holden similarly comes across as angry, embittered and frustrated, who despises \\""phonies\\"" and hypocrites, cannot help exaggerating and lying, and has very low tolerance levels toward those who annoy him - basically he hates everything. The darkly funny irony is of course the plight of all teenagers - they are constantly infuriated with other people's behaviour whilst completely oblivious to their own immature attitudes.<br /><br />Yet despite Holden's angst and frustration, he still comes across as an intelligent, introspective and ultimately understandable character. Whether or not you'd like him in real life is up for debate, but for the length of the novel he serves as an interesting narrator, a voice for the teenage state of mind and a mirror to our own selves: contradictive, confused and more than a little lost.<br /><br />So what is at the core of Holden Caulfield's confusion and anger? In a pivotal moment Holden's sister Phoebe asks him what it is that he *likes*. Though he momentarily struck dumb (teenagers like him don't like *anything*!) he eventually comes to a conclusion. He misquotes a poem by Robert Burn, \\""If a body catch a body coming through the rye\\"" and shares his fantasy of being this `catcher in the rye' (thus the book's title) - the individual responsible for catching children who stray too close to a dangerous cliff. It is this crucial passage that reveal the inner mind of Holden - as a teenager who longs to stay in childhood and furthermore to keep others there in a state of innocence.<br /><-ism."
